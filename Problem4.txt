What do you expect (and like) to learn in this class? If we have time at the end of the
semester to go through additional topics related to software engineering, Java or object-oriented programming,
what would you like us cover?

I expect to learn Java and the different ways to use Java to solve complex programming problems. By the end of the class, I would like to be able to use this knowledge in other situations out of class. 

If we have time at the end of the class, socket programming would be a fun topic to touch on.
